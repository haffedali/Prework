                            <p>BROCKHAMPTON is a California based boyband fouded by Kevin Abstract. He's got some abstract ideas when it comes to norms of the music industry!</p>
                            <p>The group met in a Kanye West forum, where Kevin reached out to other skilled rappers. He wanted to make a group, and the boys were all for it. They all had their own careers at this point, but they hadn't taken off yet.</p>
                            <p>The group pooled their limited funds together and got a small home together in (insert home city). Most of them continued to work part time jobs while making music. The reason they got this home together was to fully immerse themselves in their music and BROCKHAMPTON</p>
